Q: What will you do next week?

A: The class is over :(

We had our final exam this past week and finished up presentations. It was interesting to see how everyone else implemented their websites differently. I am curious to look through some of the other group's GitHub repos and learn some new things. I've already started working on another side project that uses Flask and ReactJS. The idea is to build a site for the students at my mom's school to encourage reading. The site would allow students to write reviews of books and see recommended books by other students their age at their school. Setting up the skeleton of the site took little time because of what I learned from our IDB site! I'm looking forward to learning more about web development this summer, and now have a better background to work on side projects.

My tip-of-the-week is to check out [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/). I'd never heard of it before, but it allows students to earn money by working on open-source projects. I'm probably going to try and work on one of their project ideas just for fun, as the application window has closed, but it sounds pretty cool. It looks like it would be a good summer job for incoming Freshmen or Sophomores.
