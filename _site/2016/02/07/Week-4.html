    <h1>Week 3</h1>
    <div class="content">
    <p>Q: What did you do this past week?</p>

<p>A: This week we went over types in Python and turned in Project 1 Collatz.</p>

<p>Q: What is in your way?</p>

<p>A: Keeping up with the readings for this week.</p>

<p>Q: What will you do next week?</p>

<p>A: Read <a href="http://www.around.com/ariane.html">A Bug and a Crash</a> and <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ZBWTovsmUrMJ:nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do%3Fid%3DMARIN1+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">Mariner 1</a> readings for Wednesday.</p>

<p>This week we turned in Project 1 Collatz, which was a good first project in that we had plenty of time and were very prepared to complete it. However, along the way I did make some mistakes and figured out ways to improve my code, especially by reviewing all of the Piazza posts.</p>

<p>It has been interesting studying Python with such detail, and comparing it to other languages. I have used Python much more recently than Java, however for interviews I have transitioned back to coding in Java. I like Python so much better, and it is really amazing how much more verbose Java is than Python. I am kind of interested to learn more about the advantages and disadvantages of each language, and under what circumstances each are preferred, because it seemed to me that most of the companies that were offering internships at the career fair generally use Java. Reading <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/comparisons/">this</a> explained how Java and Python actually make a great combination.</p>

<p>For my tip-of-the-week, I read <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/02/css-variables-why-should-you-care">this</a> article about how CSS variables are landing in Chrome 49. I had not read about the calc() function to determine CSS values before. I do not know much about CSS, so I like reading more about its different features. Also, this seems helpful in making CSS code a lot cleaner, something I have not been good at in the past.</p>
