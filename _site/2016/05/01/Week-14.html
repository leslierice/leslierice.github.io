    <h1>Week 14</h1>

    <p>Q: What did you do this past week?</p>

<p>A: We finished up talking about refactoring and began giving presentations.</p>

<p>Q: What is in your way?</p>

<p>A: Studying for the exam.</p>

<p>Q: What will you do next week?</p>

<p>A: Listen to more presentations and study for the exam.</p>

<p>We gave our presentation this past Friday on our completed website. It was a pretty good feeling to be completely done, and I felt very content with the work we accomplished. Looking back, it was a big project, and I learned a lot along the way. I’m looking forward to doing more web development in my free time, and learning more about React in particular. While having to deal with Docker issues was frustrating, I enjoyed every other aspect of the project. I also enjoyed getting to see some of the other groups’ sites. While we had the exact same requirements, everybody did their project slightly differently – implemented the search feature differently, for example, and had unique features that made their site stand out. This next week I’m going to be focusing on studying for the exam Thursday.</p>

<p>My tip-of-the-week is to check out <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> if you used Angular for the project and haven’t used React before. I had only been exposed to Angular previously, but I like React a lot. I especially think students should be able to use React on their projects next semester. After one of my teammates explained it to me, I found it really easy to use.</p>
